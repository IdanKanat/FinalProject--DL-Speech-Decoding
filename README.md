# Final Project - Data Science B.Sc. Program - TAU - 2025 - Decoding of Speech Features from Single Neuron Recordings from the Human Brain
Individuals with neurological disorders, e.g. ALS, brain stem stroke or brain injury, may experience
significant impairments in their ability to speak, leaving them unable to communicate even their
most basic needs. In this project, we aimed to tackle this important problem by developing a model
that decodes speech directly from electrical brain signals.

Our project aimed to develop and compare Deep Learning (DL) models for offline decoding of
vowel articulations directly from the electrical activity of single neurons in the brain of epilepsy
patients.

Experimental results show, on the one hand, that there is no universal “best” model, out of the
models that we tested, across all individuals; on the other hand, they demonstrate the technical
feasibility of decoding speech elements from single neuron recordings.

This project was conducted as a collaboration between the School of Industrial & Intelligent
Systems Engineering at Tel Aviv University and Dr. Tankus from Sourasky Medical Center
(Ichilov). The work is built upon earlier research by Dr. Tankus, which demonstrated the
classification of two vowel sounds from the neural recordings of a single patient. Our project took
this further, extending it to more phonemes and more patients. Ultimately, this project could pave
the way for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) that will restore speech communication in completely
paralyzed patients.

Due to patients' privacy, the project's data & code could not be revealed here.
